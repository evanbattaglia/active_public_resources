        "description":"Joshua Katz is a high school math teacher in Orange County, FL. \n\nJoshua's Talk:\nIn the mid 1800's, Horace Mann captured the potential impact of education on society.  We have yet to realize the potential he saw, and in fact, we are missing the mark by a wider and wider margin.  We have created a \"Toxic Culture of Education\" in our country that is damaging students, impacting our economy, and threatening our future.  Since the passage of No Child Left Behind, we have embraced a culture of high stakes testing and are perpetuating a false sense of failure in our schools.  We have ignored research and data on effective policy making practices in order to serve the interest of private industries that have monetized our students.  The impact is being felt in communities, on college campuses, and in our economy.  The solution lies in a common sense approach to student development, curriculum choice, career exploration, and relevant data analysis.  This talk will present a vision of an education system that allows us to embrace our full potential if we only had the courage to ask \"Why Not\"?\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event:\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Why is it that some of the most high profile and successful figures within the Western world openly admit to never having completed any form of higher learning? \n\nPaying homage to Jefferson Bethke's  \"Why I Hate Religion but Love Jesus\", a piece that received 22 million views in the space of a week, I address a number of these issues in my offering \"Why I Hate School, but Love Education\".\n\nWith scores of school leavers wanting to further their education with no guarantee of their dream job at the end of it, we should ask ourselves whether qualifications still hold the same value now as they did in previous years?\n \nDoes success in the school system correlate to success in life? Or is the school system simply geared towards fact retention and regurgitation?\n\nWhat is true education?\n\n@sulibreaks\nuniversityofsulibreaks.tumblr.com\n\n Director: @KevinNgongo\nwww.youtube.com/kevinngongo\n\nGraphics: www.mikegallardodesigns.com\n\nMusic: Sunshine: Surface Of The Sun - John Murphy - Adagio in D Minor\n\nCheck my next video \"The American'T Dream\": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzcxOl4b7IA\n\nContact: info@sulibreaks.com\n\nVIDEOGRAPHER INFO:\n\n\nEmail: Kevin.Ngongo@gmail.com \n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/KevinNgongo\n\nFacebook: www.Facebook.com/KevinNgongo Will be releasing these more consistently on either a Thursday or Sunday every week as part of my \"LECTURES\" series, while I'm attempting to finish my latest album.

Why is it that some of the most high profile and successful figures within the Western world openly admit to never having completed any form of higher learning? \n\nPaying homage to Jefferson Bethke's  \"Why I Hate Religion but Love Jesus\", a piece that received 22 million views in the space of a week, I address a number of these issues in my offering \"Why I Hate School, but Love Education\".\n\nWith scores of school leavers wanting to further their education with no guarantee of their dream job at the end of it, we should ask ourselves whether qualifications still hold the same value now as they did in previous years?\n \nDoes success in the school system correlate to success in life? Or is the school system simply geared towards fact retention and regurgitation?\n\nWhat is true education?\n\n@sulibreaks\nuniversityofsulibreaks.tumblr.com\n\n Director: @KevinNgongo\nwww.youtube.com/kevinngongo\n\nGraphics: www.mikegallardodesigns.com\n\nMusic: Sunshine: Surface Of The Sun - John Murphy - Adagio in D Minor\n\nCheck my next video \"The American'T Dream\": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzcxOl4b7IA\n\nContact: info@sulibreaks.com\n\nVIDEOGRAPHER INFO:\n\n\nEmail: Kevin.Ngongo@gmail.com \n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/KevinNgongo\n\nFacebook: www.Facebook.com/KevinNgongo Will be releasing these more consistently on either a Thursday or Sunday every week as part of my \"LECTURES\" series, while I'm attempting to finish my latest album.

        "title":"Is private education good for society? | The Economist",
        "description":"Across the world private education is booming. Though private schools and tuition promote inequality, Emma Duncan, our social policy editor, explains why governments should embrace the private sector's rise\n\nRead more here: https://econ.st/2X4ODsm\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy \n\nThere is a big boom in private education all over the world. You see it in schooling numbers. The numbers of people going to private primary has gone up from 10 to 17 percent over the last 15 years. Secondaries gone up from 9 to 27 percent. Then if you look in particular countries you find for instance in China, there's a big increase in people going to elite private schools. But also huge business in terms of people getting online tuition. Parents are finding ways to spend money on the great competition to improve their children's brains.\n\nThe resurgence is happening for a few different reasons and one of them is that incomes are going up, the birth rates are going down. So in families all over the world there is more money to spend on each child. If you look at the Chinese one-child policy you get six people: four grandparents, two parents, all of them willing to invest in the education of one child. At the same time you've had the whole of the world economy changing so that there are fewer unskilled jobs everywhere - almost all decent jobs require you to have a qualification of some sort. \n\nThe great advantage of private education is that it's fantastically good at getting children in school. In countries where people are moving around a lot, which is most of the developing world, and where populations are growing swiftly - you get this huge swift urbanization. Governments just can't keep up. You'll get governments like Pakistan struggling with fast growing cities and has partnered up with the with the private sector to send poor kids, who would otherwise not be getting schooling at all, into private schools - and they're doing that with over two million kids. Private schools can also be really really good because you know often parents are willing to spend masses of money and you get a really high quality of education.\n\nIt is a dilemma for society. Governments need to concern themselves about equality and about social mobility. Things that the private sector discourages rather than encourages. The problem with private schools is that they do tend to increase inequality. When parents are allowed to spend money on their children they will spend as much as they can so obviously rich kids go to better schools. \n\nYou see China which is increasingly putting controls on the expansion in the school's business. It's clearly pretty uncomfortable about it. Rather than trying to shut it down governments need to be trying to work with it. Now there is a cost. If you allow the private sector to operate you are going to get a higher level of inequality but I think that that is a price worth paying for the Liberty, for the resources, for the better brains, for the innovation for the quality of education, and the breadth of education that you get if you allow the private sector to operate. I think governments must look at the private sector as a potential partner, not as they do in some places as an enemy.\n\nFor more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ \nFollow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist",

          "description":"Across the world private education is booming. Though private schools and tuition promote inequality, Emma Duncan, our social policy editor, explains why governments should embrace the private sector's rise\n\nRead more here: https://econ.st/2X4ODsm\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy \n\nThere is a big boom in private education all over the world. You see it in schooling numbers. The numbers of people going to private primary has gone up from 10 to 17 percent over the last 15 years. Secondaries gone up from 9 to 27 percent. Then if you look in particular countries you find for instance in China, there's a big increase in people going to elite private schools. But also huge business in terms of people getting online tuition. Parents are finding ways to spend money on the great competition to improve their children's brains.\n\nThe resurgence is happening for a few different reasons and one of them is that incomes are going up, the birth rates are going down. So in families all over the world there is more money to spend on each child. If you look at the Chinese one-child policy you get six people: four grandparents, two parents, all of them willing to invest in the education of one child. At the same time you've had the whole of the world economy changing so that there are fewer unskilled jobs everywhere - almost all decent jobs require you to have a qualification of some sort. \n\nThe great advantage of private education is that it's fantastically good at getting children in school. In countries where people are moving around a lot, which is most of the developing world, and where populations are growing swiftly - you get this huge swift urbanization. Governments just can't keep up. You'll get governments like Pakistan struggling with fast growing cities and has partnered up with the with the private sector to send poor kids, who would otherwise not be getting schooling at all, into private schools - and they're doing that with over two million kids. Private schools can also be really really good because you know often parents are willing to spend masses of money and you get a really high quality of education.\n\nIt is a dilemma for society. Governments need to concern themselves about equality and about social mobility. Things that the private sector discourages rather than encourages. The problem with private schools is that they do tend to increase inequality. When parents are allowed to spend money on their children they will spend as much as they can so obviously rich kids go to better schools. \n\nYou see China which is increasingly putting controls on the expansion in the school's business. It's clearly pretty uncomfortable about it. Rather than trying to shut it down governments need to be trying to work with it. Now there is a cost. If you allow the private sector to operate you are going to get a higher level of inequality but I think that that is a price worth paying for the Liberty, for the resources, for the better brains, for the innovation for the quality of education, and the breadth of education that you get if you allow the private sector to operate. I think governments must look at the private sector as a potential partner, not as they do in some places as an enemy.\n\nFor more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ \nFollow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist"
